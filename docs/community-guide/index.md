# Community Guide

## Overview
### Core Team
### Values
## Community Flywheel (Getting Started)
- Really like the concept of the [flywheel and building momentum with your community](https://orbit.love/blog/a-tactical-guide-to-kickstarting-your-community)
### Make Everyone Feel Welcome
### Be Responsive
### Give More Than You Take
One of the best mechanisms for building and fostering a growing community is to give as much as possible to the group. This giving can come in the form of advice and insight, documentation and how-tos, screencasts, and social events. Consider the value that a member gets from the organization and how that might encourage them to contribute. Only after you've given substantially to the community should you ask your members or contributors to do something. Not only will this make the community feel like they're getting _real_ value from the group (make it worth their time) but it will also inspire genuine and meaningful contributions.
#### Examples of Giving
- Screencast showing the basics of submitting a pull request to the project
- Community leaders writing and publishing documentation and best-practices as guideposts for members
- Using Twitter and other social media platforms to talk about _how to use_ the software/system/project in your own project
#### Examples of Asking
- Using Twitter or other social media platforms to ask your members to _do something_ (e.g. fill out a form, take a survey, read a blog post, sign up for a newsletter, etc)
### Handoff/Keeping the Flywheel Spinning
## Events and Rituals

### Developer meetings

- **Scope:** Coordination of ongoing development activities
- **Who should attend:** Active contributors to the project, maintainers, project lead
- **Timing:** Depends on project size, ranges from daily to yearly
- **Duration:** Usually 1 hour
- **Advice:** Record progress through issues and pull requests

### Community meetings

- **Scope:** Communication of development activities and events with the broader community, opportunity for community feedback
- **Who should attend:** Typically open to everyone
- **Timing:** Depends on project size, ranges from weekly to quarterly
- **Duration:** Usually 1 hour
- **Advice:**
    - Require registration or have a waiting room
    - Designate a leader for the community meeting
    - Designate a separate note taker
    - Share open notes after the meeting

### Sprints/hackathons

- **Scope:** Synchronous collaboration on open source projects
- **Who should attend:** Defined by sprint organizers, could be focused on a core team, welcoming new contributors, or a combination for larger sprints
- **Timing:** Typically in conjunction with conferences, could be once per year or more frequently for larger projects
- **Duration:** Usually 1-2 days
- **Advice:** 
    - Specify goals for the sprint (e.g., targeted development towards roadmap items from core devs, onboarding new contributors)
    - If onboarding new contributors, label ‘good first issues’ and ‘help wanted’ on GitHub issues
    - If focusing on targeted technical development, communicate to conference leads that expertise is required

### Presentations

- **Scope:** Ranges from general information about the project to in-depth overview of a specific technical aspect
- **Timing:** As frequently as community members have an appetite for presenting
- **Format:** Varies from informal videos, conference presentations, podcasts, or community presentations

### Workshops

- **Scope:** In depth introduction to software tools
- **Timing:** Typically infrequently unless following a model such as Software Carpentry
- **Duration:** Typically 1-5 days
- **Advice:**
    - The people leading the workshops do not need to be the same as the person coordinating the workshop
    - Require applications and registration
    - Solicit feedback from participants

### Tutorials

- **Scope:** Succinct introduction to software
- **Timing:** As frequently as community members have an appetite for leading tutorials
- **Duration:** Typically 1 - 4 hr
- **Advice:** 
    - Clearly communicate expected prior experience and target audience
    - Record videos where possible and share for future reference

## Metrics

> I fundamentally believe that pragmatic sustainable software is better built organically and collectively. I am curious what metrics might capture these more community-supportive behaviors.

*Mathew Rocklin, DASK*

The measurement of how successful your community is can be extremely difficult to quantify. There are a number of possible indicators but they, individually, may tell only part of the whole story. They are also, generally, open to interpretation.

Given this, it would seem prudent to measure as many of these indicators as possible and interpolate to get a true picture of community vibrancy, growth, engagement, etc.

None of the suggestions below should be used in isolation as a measure. Potential pitfalls of that practice may be itemized for each suggestion below.

### How vibrant is your community?
Blurb neeed here!

#### Evolution
Is your project changing with time or stagnant?
#### Commits
How much change exists within your project?
[DASK example](https://github.com/dask/dask/graphs/commit-activity)
#### Performance
How well is your community responding to challenges?
##### Open vs Closed issues
Are you opening more issues than closing? Ideally, we would like to close more than we open.
##### Mean time to fix issues
How quickly are you resolving issues? We would like to improve on our fix rate.
#### Demographics
How is your community changing over time?
##### Joined / left project over time
We would like to grow our contribution community. We should also be cognizant of rapid increases or decreases in that community.
#### Diversity
Do we have represenation from a broad number of organizations?
If one organization leaves, would that cause significant problems?
##### Percentage authors by organization
Is one organization particularly dominant? Ideally, we would like a spread between organizations to lessen the risk of sudden community shrinkage and encourage a diversity of ideas.
##### Pony and Elephant factors
The pony factor: the minimum number of developers performing 50% of the commits
The elephant factor: the minimum number of organizations whose employees perform 50% of the commits

### How do you tell if your community is growing/working
Blurb neeed here!
#### Size
Is your community growing, stagnant or shrinking?
##### Authors
The more contributors to your project the more your project is growing. However, it is not a sole indicator growth as it is not a primary indicator of usage.

[DASK example](https://github.com/dask/dask/graphs/contributors)
##### Messsages
Much like authors, large amounts of talk about your project is an indicator of the size of your project. Two authors in regular conversation is a stronger indicator of growth than ten authors who haven't communicated for a year.

[DASK example](https://github.com/dask/dask/graphs/contributors)
##### Documentation views
Downloads and clones of your project may suffer from 'bounce' problems. Ie. I downloaded this tool but I didn't use it. Measuring the views of the projects documentation a good metric for how many users are actively engaged in the use of your project.
#### Engagement
Is our project community serving the greater community?
##### Clones/downloads/forks
The more clones and downloads of a project the more value it seems to demonstrate. However, are those clones and downloads actually used? Are they being downloaded as part of an automated provisioning process rather than an explicit use? 

[DASK example](https://github.com/dask/dask/network/members)
##### No. of dependencies
A project being used by other projects is a measure of engagement. In much the same way that citations of a paper by other papers is an indication of value.

[DASK example](https://github.com/dask/dask/network/dependencies)
##### Github stars
A very obvious but nebulous and fickle measure of engagement. Is it of value? On it's own, no. But in conjunction with other metrics it may be useful. 
Metrics: Our download numbers are huge but our github stars are low 
Possible conclusion: This is an essential project to many but it is difficult to use
