# Community Guide

## Overview
### Core Team
### Values
## Community Flywheel (Getting Started)
- Really like the concept of the [flywheel and building momentum with your community](https://orbit.love/blog/a-tactical-guide-to-kickstarting-your-community)
### Make Everyone Feel Welcome
### Be Responsive
### Give More Than You Take
One of the best mechanisms for building and fostering a growing community is to give as much as possible to the group. This giving can come in the form of advice and insight, documentation and how-tos, screencasts, and social events. Consider the value that a member gets from the organization and how that might encourage them to contribute. Only after you've given substantially to the community should you ask your members or contributors to do something. Not only will this make the community feel like they're getting _real_ value from the group (make it worth their time) but it will also inspire genuine and meaningful contributions.
#### Examples of Giving
- Screencast showing the basics of submitting a pull request to the project
- Community leaders writing and publishing documentation and best-practices as guideposts for members
- Using Twitter and other social media platforms to talk about _how to use_ the software/system/project in your own project
#### Examples of Asking
- Using Twitter or other social media platforms to ask your members to _do something_ (e.g. fill out a form, take a survey, read a blog post, sign up for a newsletter, etc)
### Handoff/Keeping the Flywheel Spinning
## Events and Rituals

### Developer meetings

- **Scope:** Coordination of ongoing development activities
- **Who should attend:** Active contributors to the project, maintainers, project lead
- **Timing:** Depends on project size, ranges from daily to yearly
- **Duration:** Usually 1 hour
- **Advice:** Record progress through issues and pull requests

### Community meetings

- **Scope:** Communication of development activities and events with the broader community, opportunity for community feedback
- **Who should attend:** Typically open to everyone
- **Timing:** Depends on project size, ranges from weekly to quarterly
- **Duration:** Usually 1 hour
- **Advice:**
    - Require registration or have a waiting room
    - Designate a leader for the community meeting
    - Designate a separate note taker
    - Share open notes after the meeting

### Sprints/hackathons

- **Scope:** Synchronous collaboration on open source projects
- **Who should attend:** Defined by sprint organizers, could be focused on a core team, welcoming new contributors, or a combination for larger sprints
- **Timing:** Typically in conjunction with conferences, could be once per year or more frequently for larger projects
- **Duration:** Usually 1-2 days
- **Advice:** 
    - Specify goals for the sprint (e.g., targeted development towards roadmap items from core devs, onboarding new contributors)
    - If onboarding new contributors, label ‘good first issues’ and ‘help wanted’ on GitHub issues
    - If focusing on targeted technical development, communicate to conference leads that expertise is required

### Presentations

- **Scope:** Ranges from general information about the project to in-depth overview of a specific technical aspect
- **Timing:** As frequently as community members have an appetite for presenting
- **Format:** Varies from informal videos, conference presentations, podcasts, or community presentations

### Workshops

- **Scope:** In depth introduction to software tools
- **Timing:** Typically infrequently unless following a model such as Software Carpentry
- **Duration:** Typically 1-5 days
- **Advice:**
    - The people leading the workshops do not need to be the same as the person coordinating the workshop
    - Require applications and registration
    - Solicit feedback from participants

### Tutorials

- **Scope:** Succinct introduction to software
- **Timing:** As frequently as community members have an appetite for leading tutorials
- **Duration:** Typically 1 - 4 hr
- **Advice:** 
    - Clearly communicate expected prior experience and target audience
