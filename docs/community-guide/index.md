### Values
## Community Flywheel (Getting Started)
- Really like the concept of the [flywheel and building momentum with your community](https://orbit.love/blog/a-tactical-guide-to-kickstarting-your-community)
### Make Everyone Feel Welcome
### Be Responsive
### Give More Than You Take
One of the best mechanisms for building and fostering a growing community is to give as much as possible to the group. This giving can come in the form of advice and insight, documentation and how-tos, screencasts, and social events. Consider the value that a member gets from the organization and how that might encourage them to contribute. Only after you've given substantially to the community should you ask your members or contributors to do something. Not only will this make the community feel like they're getting _real_ value from the group (make it worth their time) but it will also inspire genuine and meaningful contributions.
#### Examples of Giving
- Screencast showing the basics of submitting a pull request to the project
- Community leaders writing and publishing documentation and best-practices as guideposts for members
- Using Twitter and other social media platforms to talk about _how to use_ the software/system/project in your own project
#### Examples of Asking
- Using Twitter or other social media platforms to ask your members to _do something_ (e.g. fill out a form, take a survey, read a blog post, sign up for a newsletter, etc)
