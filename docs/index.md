# Community Development Best Practices

The Community Development Best Practices Working Group (CDBP) aims to promulgate best practices for fostering community for the development of open source toolsets and packages especially within the NASA Earth Science community. CDBP will continue and refine the work on the EOSDIS General Open Source Software Collaboration and Contribution Process guide and add sections on community development best-practices and actionable templates (pull requests, marketing copy, community contacts) to help ESDS open source projects engage with, and develop a community around their project.
